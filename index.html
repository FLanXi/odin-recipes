    <p><strong> French omelette </strong>starts out with beaten eggs in the pan (just like scrambled eggs). The pan is shaken constantly during cooking until the eggs just begin to set. When the eggs are cooked, the omelette is rolled and snugly folded to form an oval and finally turned out onto a plate with the seam side down.</p>

    <p>It can be plain or filled, with or without cheese. (An omelette with fines herbes is a famous standard French dish. An assortment of chopped herbs is stirred into the eggs before cooking; no cheese.)</p>

    <p><strong>American omelette (or "omelet" as they are sometimes spelled) </strong> starts out in the same way, but as the eggs cook, the edges are lifted from the sides of the pan with a spatula so the runny eggs can flow underneath.</p>

    <p>When the eggs are nearly set, the filling is added and the omelette is folded in half rather than rolled.</p>
