    <h1>Omelette Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/omelette.webp" height="310" width="310" alt="omelette">

    <p><strong> French omelette </strong>starts out with beaten eggs in the pan (just like scrambled eggs). The pan is shaken constantly during cooking until the eggs just begin to set. When the eggs are cooked, the omelette is rolled and snugly folded to form an oval and finally turned out onto a plate with the seam side down.</p>

    <p>It can be plain or filled, with or without cheese. (An omelette with fines herbes is a famous standard French dish. An assortment of chopped herbs is stirred into the eggs before cooking; no cheese.)</p>

    <p><strong>American omelette (or "omelet" as they are sometimes spelled) </strong> starts out in the same way, but as the eggs cook, the edges are lifted from the sides of the pan with a spatula so the runny eggs can flow underneath.</p>

    <p>When the eggs are nearly set, the filling is added and the omelette is folded in half rather than rolled.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon grated cheese</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half sprinkled lightly with salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the eggs:</strong> Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a small pinch of salt and beat the eggs with a fork until they are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter:</strong>In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and cook the omelette:</strong>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook without stirring until the edges begin to set. With a silicone spatula, push the edges toward the center of the pan and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs move to the edge.
            Repeat until the eggs are somewhat set but still a little soft in the center, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the omelette:</strong>Place the cheese, tomatoes, and herbs in a line down the center of the omelette and cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a little soft in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold and plate the omelette:</strong>Fold and plate the omelette:
            Slide the spatula around one side of the omelette at the edge to loosen it. Slip it under the eggs, and use it to carefully fold the omelette in half. Slide the spatula under the folded omelette to loosen it from the pan. Tilt the pan over a plate and use the spatula to nudge it onto the plate. Voila!</li>
    </ol>
